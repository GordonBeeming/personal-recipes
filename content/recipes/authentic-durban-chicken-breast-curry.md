#### **Ingredients**

**For the Masala (Spice Mix):**

* 1 tbsp Coriander Seeds
* 2 tsp Cumin Seeds
* 1 tsp Fennel Seeds
* 4-5 Whole Cloves
* 2 Cardamom Pods, slightly crushed
* 1 small piece of Cinnamon Stick (about 2-3 cm)
* 3 tbsp Kashmiri Chilli Powder (this is key for colour without excessive heat)
* 1 tsp Turmeric Powder
* 1 tsp Hot Chilli Powder or Cayenne Pepper (adjust to your family's preference!)

**For the Curry:**

* 1 kg Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breast, cut into large 4-5 cm chunks
* 3 tbsp Vegetable Oil or Ghee
* 2 large Onions, finely chopped
* 1 sprig of fresh Curry Leaves
* 2 tbsp Ginger-Garlic Paste (freshly made is best)
* 400g tin of Chopped Tomatoes
* 500g Potatoes, peeled and quartered
* 250 ml Chicken Stock or Hot Water
* Salt to taste
* A handful of fresh Coriander (Dhania), chopped, for garnish

#### **Instructions**

1.  **Create Your Masala:**
    * In a dry pan over medium heat, toast the whole spices (coriander, cumin, fennel, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon) for about 2-3 minutes until they become fragrant. Keep them moving so they don't burn!
    * Let them cool slightly, then grind them into a fine powder using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle.
    * Mix this ground powder with the Kashmiri chilli powder, turmeric, and hot chilli powder. Set your beautiful, fresh masala aside.

2.  **Start the Base (The 'Braise'):**
    * Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
    * Add the finely chopped onions and a good pinch of salt. Sauté for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are soft and deeply golden brown. Don't rush this step – it builds a sweet, rich foundation.
    * Add the curry leaves and the ginger-garlic paste. Cook for another minute until fragrant.
    * Add your freshly made masala powder. Stir constantly for about 30-45 seconds. It will become very fragrant and darken slightly. This step cooks out the raw spice taste. Be ready with your tomatoes!

3.  **Build the Gravy:**
    * Immediately add the tinned tomatoes to the pot to stop the spices from burning. Stir everything together, scraping the bottom of the pot. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the tomatoes break down and the oil starts to separate at the edges.

4.  **Cook the Potatoes:**
    * Add the quartered potatoes and stir to coat them in the gravy.
    * Pour in the chicken stock or hot water and season with about 1 tsp of salt. Bring to a simmer.
    * Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it gently bubble away for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are about halfway tender.

5.  **Add the Chicken:**
    * Add the chicken breast chunks to the pot, stirring gently to submerge them in the gravy.
    * Cover and continue to simmer for a final 10-15 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through and tender. Be careful not to overcook it.

6.  **Finishing Touches:**
    * Stir in the fresh chopped coriander. Check for seasoning and add more salt if needed.
    * For the best flavour, let it rest for at least 10 minutes off the heat before serving.

#### **Serving Suggestions**

The rich, aromatic gravy is the heart of this dish, and you won't want to waste a single drop. It's traditionally served with fluffy basmati rice or warm naan bread, which are perfect for soaking up every last bit of flavour. 

For the ultimate authentic Durban experience, you can create a 'Bunny Chow' by hollowing out a quarter loaf of fresh white bread and filling it with the curry—it's a delicious, messy, and unforgettable way to eat! (Keep an eye out, as a dedicated post on how to make the perfect bunny chow is coming soon).
