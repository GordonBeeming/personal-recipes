#### **Ingredients**

**For the Pork Roast:**

* 2.6 kg Boneless Pork Shoulder Roast, rolled and netted (or tied)
* 2-3 tbsp Coarse Sea Salt
* 1 tbsp Olive Oil or Vegetable Oil
* 2 large Onions, peeled and roughly chopped
* 1 whole head of Garlic, cloves separated and lightly smashed
* 500 ml Chicken or Vegetable Stock, plus extra if needed

**For the Roast Vegetables:**

* 1.5 kg Potatoes (e.g., King Edward, Maris Piper), peeled and chopped into 4-5 cm chunks
* 5-6 Carrots, peeled and chopped into large chunks
* 500g Pumpkin, peeled and cut into cubes
* 2 Red Peppers, deseeded and cut into large chunks
* 4-5 Patty Pan Squash ("gold squash"), halved or quartered
* 2 tbsp Olive Oil
* Salt and freshly ground Black Pepper

**For the Sides:**

* 500g Green Beans, trimmed
* 250g Mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced or quartered
* 1 tbsp Olive Oil (for mushrooms)

**For the Gravy & Sauce:**

* 1 packet of ready-to-use Gravy (e.g., Mingle Traditional Gravy)
* 1 tbsp Cornstarch, mixed with 2 tbsp cold water (optional, for thickening)
* 1 jar of Apple Sauce, to serve

#### **Instructions**

1. **The Night Before - Prep the Pork:**
   * If the netting on your roast prevents scoring the rind, carefully remove it. A rolled roast should hold its shape, but you can re-tie it in a few places with butcher's twine if needed, leaving the rind fully exposed.
   * Using a very sharp knife, score the rind in a diamond pattern or in parallel lines, about 5mm deep. Cut through the skin and into the fat, but try not to cut into the meat.
   * Pat the entire roast, especially the rind, completely dry with paper towels.
   * Place the roast on a rack over a tray and leave it uncovered in the fridge overnight. This is the secret to amazing crackling!

2. **Roasting Day - Prepare the Roast:**
   * Take the pork out of the fridge about 1 hour before cooking to let it come to room temperature.
   * Preheat your oven to 240°C (465°F).
   * Scatter the chopped onions and smashed garlic cloves on the bottom of a large roasting pan.
   * Give the rind one final, thorough pat-down with paper towels to ensure it's bone dry. Rub the coarse salt generously all over the rind, working it into the scores. Drizzle with 1 tbsp of olive oil and rub it in.

3. **Cook the Pork - The Crackling Stage:**
   * Place the pork roast on top of the onions and garlic in the pan (or on a rack above them).
   * Roast at the high temperature of 240°C for 40-50 minutes. The rind should start to puff, bubble, and turn golden. This is the initial "blast" that creates the crackling.

4. **Cook the Pork - The Slow Roast:**
   * After the high-heat blast, reduce the oven temperature to 160°C (320°F).
   * Carefully pour about 250 ml of stock into the bottom of the pan, around the meat (not over the crackling!).
   * Continue to roast for approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes to 3 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 71-77°C (160-170°F) on a meat thermometer.

5. **Prepare and Roast the Vegetables:**
   * About 1 hour and 30 minutes before the pork is due to be ready, prepare your roasting vegetables.
   * Toss the potatoes, carrots, and pumpkin in a large bowl with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread them in a single layer on one or two large baking trays.
   * Place them in the oven with the pork.
   * About 45 minutes later, add the chopped peppers and patty pan squash to the trays, tossing them with the other vegetables.

6. **Rest the Pork (Crucial!):**
   * Once the pork reaches its target temperature, remove it from the oven and transfer it to a warm platter or cutting board. Tent it loosely with foil and let it rest for at least 30-45 minutes. Do not skip this step!
   * While the pork is resting, turn the oven temperature up to 200°C (400°F) to give the vegetables a final roasting blast to help them get golden and crispy. Keep an eye on them.

7. **The Final 30 Minutes - Sides and Gravy:**
   * **Make the Gravy:** Skim the excess fat from the pork's roasting pan. Pour the remaining pan juices (with the soft onions/garlic if you like a rustic gravy, or strained for a smooth one) into a saucepan. Add your packet of ready-to-use gravy and heat gently. If you prefer it thicker, add the cornstarch slurry and simmer while stirring until it reaches your desired consistency.
   * **Pan-fry Mushrooms:** Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Fry the mushrooms until nicely browned (5-10 minutes). Season with salt and pepper.
   * **Steam Green Beans:** Steam or boil the green beans for 4-7 minutes until tender-crisp. Toss with a little olive oil and salt.

8. **Carve and Serve:**
   * After resting, remove any netting or string from the pork. Carve the meat and serve with a piece of the amazing crackling.
   * Arrange the roast vegetables, mushrooms, and green beans on the plates. Serve hot with the gravy and a spoonful of apple sauce on the side. Enjoy your incredible feast!
