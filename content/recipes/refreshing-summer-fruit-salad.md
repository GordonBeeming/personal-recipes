#### **Ingredients**

**For the Fruit Salad:**

* 1 large Dragon Fruit
* 500g fresh Pineapple Chunks (if using tinned, reserve a little juice)
* 500g Grapes, red or green
* 2 crisp Apples (like Royal Gala, Pink Lady, or Granny Smith)
* 1 cup Frozen Fruit mix (optional, berries or mango work well)

**For Serving:**

* Vanilla Ice Cream
* Chocolate Ice Cream
* Dollop Cream

#### **Instructions**

1. **Prepare the Fruit:**
   * Wash all the fresh fruit.
   * Slice the dragon fruit in half and either cube the flesh or use a melon baller for nice round scoops.
   * If your pineapple isn't already cubed, cut it into bite-sized chunks.
   * Remove the grapes from the stem. If they are large, you can slice them in half.
   * **Prep the apples last to prevent browning.** Core and chop the apples into bite-sized pieces. Immediately place them in a large serving bowl and toss with a tablespoon of the reserved pineapple juice (or a small squeeze of lemon/lime juice if you have it). This will keep them looking fresh and white.
2. **Combine and Chill:**
   * Add the prepared dragon fruit, pineapple, and grapes to the bowl with the apples.
   * If you're using frozen fruit, gently fold it in now. The frozen berries or mango will add a lovely colour and help keep the salad chilled.
   * Gently toss all the fruits together until just combined.
   * For the best flavour, cover the bowl and chill in the refrigerator for at least 15-30 minutes before serving.
3. **Serve:**
   * Present the beautiful fruit salad in its large serving bowl.
   * Set out bowls with scoops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, and another small bowl with the dollop cream.
   * Let everyone help themselves to a serving of fruit salad and finish it with their favourite topping. Enjoy!
