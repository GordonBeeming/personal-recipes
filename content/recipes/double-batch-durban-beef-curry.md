Sometimes one pot just isn't enough. Whether you're feeding a crowd, prepping for the week, or just want to ensure there are plenty of leftovers (because curry always tastes better the next day), this double batch recipe has you covered.

### ⚠️ Key Differences From the Single Batch

If you've made my standard curry before, there are **three critical changes** when cooking this volume:

1. **The Onion "Braise" Takes Longer**: With double the onions, there is much more water to cook out. Do not rush this step. It will take **20-25 minutes** (not 10) to get them properly golden brown.
2. **Add Potatoes Later:** In a massive pot with 2kg of meat, potatoes at the bottom tend to get crushed or dissolve over a 2-hour cook. **Add them halfway through** (after the beef has simmered for an hour) to keep them perfect.
3. **Pot Size Matters:** You need at least an **8L to 11L pot** with a thick base to prevent scorching.

#### **Ingredients**

**For the Masala (Spice Mix):**

* 2 tbsp Coriander Seeds
* 4 tsp Cumin Seeds
* 2 tsp Fennel Seeds
* 8-10 Whole Cloves
* 4 Cardamom Pods, slightly crushed
* 1 medium Cinnamon Stick (about 5-6 cm)
* 6 tbsp Kashmiri Chilli Powder (Essential for that deep red colour)
* 2 tsp Turmeric Powder
* 2 tsp Hot Chilli Powder or Cayenne Pepper (Adjust carefully!)

**For the Curry:**

* 2 kg Beef Chuck or Brisket, cut into 3-4 cm cubes
* 6 tbsp Vegetable Oil or Ghee
* 4 large Onions, finely chopped
* 2 sprigs of fresh Curry Leaves
* 4 tbsp Ginger-Garlic Paste
* 2 x 400g tins of Chopped Tomatoes (800g total)
* 1 kg Potatoes, peeled and quartered
* 1 Litre Beef Stock or Hot Water
* Salt to taste (Start with 3 tsp and adjust at the end)
* A large handful of fresh Coriander (Dhania), chopped, for garnish

#### **Instructions**

1. **Create Your Masala:**
   * In a dry pan over medium heat, toast the whole spices (coriander, cumin, fennel, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon) for about 3-4 minutes until fragrant.
   * Let them cool, grind to a fine powder, and mix with the Kashmiri chilli, turmeric, and hot chilli powder. Set aside.
2. **The "Big Braise":**
   * Heat the oil in your large stock pot (11L is ideal) over medium-high heat.
   * Add the chopped onions and a generous pinch of salt. Sauté for **20-25 minutes**. You want them soft and deeply golden brown. Be patient; this is where the flavour lives.
   * Add the curry leaves and ginger-garlic paste. Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
   * Add your masala powder. Stir constantly for 45-60 seconds. It will be a lot of spice, so keep it moving so it doesn't burn!
3. **Build the Base:**
   * Immediately add both tins of tomatoes. Stir well, scraping the bottom of the pot. Cook for **10-12 minutes** until the tomatoes break down and the oil separates at the edges.
   * Increase the heat slightly and add the beef cubes. Stir thoroughly to coat every piece of meat in the paste. Cook for 5-8 minutes to let the beef heat up.
4. **The First Simmer (Beef Only):**
   * Pour in the beef stock or hot water and season with salt. Bring to a boil.
   * Once bubbling, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for **1 hour**. Stir occasionally to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom.
5. **Add the Potatoes:**
   * After the hour is up, add your quartered potatoes. Stir them gently into the gravy.
   * Cover and simmer for another **45-60 minutes**.
   * The curry is ready when the beef is fork-tender and the potatoes are soft but holding their shape.
6. **Finishing Touches:**
   * Stir in the fresh chopped coriander. Check for seasoning—with this volume, you might need a touch more salt.
   * Let it rest for 20 minutes before serving to let the oils settle and flavours meld.

#### **Serving Suggestions**

The rich, aromatic gravy is the heart of this dish, and you won't want to waste a single drop. It's traditionally served with fluffy basmati rice or warm naan bread, which are perfect for soaking up every last bit of flavour. For the ultimate authentic Durban experience, you can create a 'Bunny Chow' by hollowing out a quarter loaf of fresh white bread and filling it with the curry—it's a delicious, messy, and unforgettable way to eat! (Keep an eye out, as a dedicated post on how to make the perfect bunny chow is coming soon).

#### A Personal Twist

Alright, I have to share a personal (and for some, controversial) serving suggestion. Growing up in South Africa, we often had our curry with a side of sambals – a simple mix of chopped tomato and onion is a classic. My own unique twist, though, is to chop up half a banana and mix it in with my rice. The sweetness provides a fantastic contrast to the spicy, savoury gravy. It might not be for everyone, but if you're feeling adventurous, I highly recommend giving it a try! 😉
