#### **Ingredients**

**For the Masala (Spice Mix):**

* 1 tbsp Coriander Seeds
* 2 tsp Cumin Seeds
* 1 tsp Fennel Seeds
* 4-5 Whole Cloves
* 2 Cardamom Pods, slightly crushed
* 1 small piece of Cinnamon Stick (about 2-3 cm)
* 3 tbsp Kashmiri Chilli Powder (this is key for colour without excessive heat)
* 1 tsp Turmeric Powder
* 1 tsp Hot Chilli Powder or Cayenne Pepper (adjust to your family's preference!)

**For the Curry:**

* 1 kg Beef Chuck or Brisket, cut into 3-4 cm cubes
* 3 tbsp Vegetable Oil or Ghee
* 2 large Onions, finely chopped
* 1 sprig of fresh Curry Leaves
* 2 tbsp Ginger-Garlic Paste (freshly made is best)
* 400g tin of Chopped Tomatoes
* 500g Potatoes, peeled and quartered
* 500 ml Beef Stock or Hot Water
* Salt to taste
* A handful of fresh Coriander (Dhania), chopped, for garnish

#### **Instructions**

1. **Create Your Masala:**
   * In a dry pan over medium heat, toast the whole spices (coriander, cumin, fennel, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon) for about 2-3 minutes until they become fragrant. Keep them moving so they don't burn!
   * Let them cool slightly, then grind them into a fine powder using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle.
   * Mix this ground powder with the Kashmiri chilli powder, turmeric, and hot chilli powder. Set your beautiful, fresh masala aside.
2. **Start the Base (The 'Braise'):**
   * Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
   * Add the finely chopped onions and a good pinch of salt. Sauté for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are soft and deeply golden brown. Don't rush this step – it builds a sweet, rich foundation.
   * Add the curry leaves and the ginger-garlic paste. Cook for another minute until fragrant.
   * Add your freshly made masala powder. Stir constantly for about 30-45 seconds. It will become very fragrant and darken slightly. This step cooks out the raw spice taste. Be ready with your tomatoes!
3. **Build the Curry:**
   * Immediately add the tinned tomatoes to the pot to stop the spices from burning. Stir everything together, scraping the bottom of the pot. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the tomatoes break down and the oil starts to separate at the edges.
   * Add the beef cubes to the pot. Stir well to coat all the meat with the glorious paste. Cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the beef to brown a little.
   * Pour in the beef stock or hot water, add the potatoes, and season with about 1.5 tsp of salt. Bring it to a simmer.
4. **The Magic Step - Low and Slow:**
   * Once simmering, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it gently bubble away for at least 1.5 to 2 hours. Stir it every 20-30 minutes to make sure it's not sticking.
   * The curry is ready when the beef is fork-tender, the potatoes are soft, and the gravy has thickened beautifully.
5. **Finishing Touches:**
   * Stir in the fresh chopped coriander. Check for seasoning and add more salt if needed.
   * For the best flavour, let it rest for at least 20 minutes off the heat before serving. Honestly, it's even better the next day!
