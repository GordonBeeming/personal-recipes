# Tina Cloud Branch Indexing Fix

**Date**: 2025-01-05  
**Issue**: Branch 'main' not indexed on TinaCloud
**Solution**: Push to GitHub - indexing happens automatically

## The Problem

Tina Cloud shows: "Branch 'main' is not on TinaCloud"

This means Tina Cloud hasn't indexed your branch yet.

## The Solution (From Tina Docs)

**Tina Cloud automatically indexes branches when it detects changes.**

You don't manually trigger indexing - it happens when you push!

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

This triggers Tina Cloud to:
1. Detect the push
2. Automatically index the branch
3. Make it available for builds

### Step 2: Wait for Automatic Indexing

After pushing:
- Tina Cloud detects the change (usually within 1-2 minutes)
- Automatically indexes the branch
- No manual action needed!

### Step 3: Verify in Tina Cloud

1. Go to https://app.tina.io
2. Select your project
3. Go to Configuration → Branches
4. You should see `main` branch listed after indexing completes

## Workflow is Already Updated

The workflow now handles this gracefully:
```yaml
- name: Build Tina (with Cloud check)
  run: npm run build:tina || echo "Tina build failed, continuing with local schema"
```

This means:
- **First deployment**: Uses existing local schema (site works!)
- **After Tina indexes**: Future deployments rebuild from Tina Cloud
- **Admin panel**: Works once indexing completes

## What Happens Now

### Immediate (First Push):
1. You push to GitHub
2. Tina Cloud starts indexing (automatic)
3. GitHub Actions runs
4. Tina build may fail (branch still indexing)
5. Uses existing schema instead
6. **Site deploys successfully** ✓

### After ~2-5 Minutes:
1. Tina Cloud finishes indexing
2. Branch is available
3. Next deployment rebuilds from Tina Cloud
4. Admin panel at /admin works ✓

## The Key Insight

**You don't trigger indexing manually.**
**Tina Cloud indexes automatically when you push code.**

Just push to GitHub and wait a few minutes!

## Ready to Deploy

```bash
# Push everything
git push origin main

# Watch GitHub Actions
# First build might show Tina warning (OK!)
# Site deploys with existing schema
# Wait 2-5 minutes for Tina Cloud indexing
# Future deployments will use Tina Cloud
```

---

**Status**: Understanding corrected - indexing is automatic on push
**Action**: Push to GitHub and wait for automatic indexing
**Impact**: Site deploys immediately, admin works after indexing completes
