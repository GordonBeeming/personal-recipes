# Remove Playwright Tests

**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Task**: Remove Playwright test infrastructure as tests were never running properly

## Problem

Playwright tests were configured but:
- Never ran successfully in the environment
- Required browser binaries that weren't installed
- Added complexity without providing value
- Manual testing is more appropriate for this small project

## Solution

Completely removed Playwright testing infrastructure and updated documentation to reflect manual testing approach.

## Files Removed

- `tests/recipe-website.spec.ts` - Test specification file
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration

## Files Modified

### `/package.json`
**Scripts removed**:
- `test: "playwright test"`
- `test:ui: "playwright test --ui"`
- `test:headed: "playwright test --headed"`

**DevDependencies removed**:
- `@playwright/test: "^1.55.1"`

### `/.gitignore`
**Entries removed**:
- `/test-results/`
- `/playwright-report/`
- `/playwright/.cache/`
- `# tests/screenshots/` comment

### `/.github/copilot-instructions.md`
**Sections updated**:
- Removed "Automated Testing with Playwright" section
- Changed to "Manual Testing" approach
- Removed Playwright test commands from "After Making Changes"
- Removed Playwright references from "Before Committing"
- Updated version from 2.1.0 to 2.2.0
- Updated "Last Updated" date to 2025-10-07
- Changed testing approach from "Playwright for functionality verification" to "Manual testing and validation"
- Updated critical guideline #12 from "Run Playwright tests" to "Build and manually test functionality in browser"

## Testing Approach Going Forward

### Manual Testing Checklist
Before committing changes:
- [ ] Build succeeds: `npm run build:local`
- [ ] Linting passes: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Test in dev mode: `npm run dev:prod`
- [ ] Manually test affected functionality in browser
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation (if applicable)
- [ ] Test responsive design (if UI changes)
- [ ] Verify accessibility with screen reader (if applicable)
- [ ] Check color contrast (if visual changes)

### When to Test
- After any code changes
- Before committing
- After updating dependencies
- When fixing bugs
- When adding new features

## Benefits

1. **Simpler setup** - No test infrastructure to maintain
2. **Faster development** - No waiting for tests to run
3. **Reduced dependencies** - One less dev dependency
4. **Clearer expectations** - Manual testing is explicit
5. **More appropriate** - Better suited for a small personal project

## Follow-up

None required - manual testing is sufficient for this project.
