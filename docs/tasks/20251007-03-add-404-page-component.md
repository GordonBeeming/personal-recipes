# Add Proper 404 Page Component

**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Task**: Create a user-friendly 404 page for invalid routes and missing recipes

## Problem

After implementing the SPA routing fix for GitHub Pages, the app was redirecting all invalid routes back to the homepage. This meant:
- Users couldn't tell if they visited an invalid URL
- No feedback when a recipe doesn't exist
- Poor user experience - silently redirecting is confusing

## Solution

Created a dedicated `NotFoundPage` component that displays when:
1. User navigates to an invalid route (e.g., `/invalid-page`)
2. User tries to access a recipe that doesn't exist (e.g., `/recipe/does-not-exist`)
3. Any other route not defined in the app

## Files Created

### `/src/components/NotFoundPage.tsx`
A new accessible 404 page component with:
- **Consistent design**: Uses the app's Header component and theme
- **Clear messaging**: Large "404" error code and friendly message
- **Visual element**: Cooking pot emoji (üç≥) for brand consistency
- **Navigation options**: 
  - "Back to Recipe Collection" button (goes to homepage)
  - "Go Back" button (browser back navigation)
- **Accessibility**: 
  - Proper ARIA labels for the error code
  - Semantic HTML structure
  - Keyboard-accessible buttons
  - Screen reader-friendly content
- **Helpful text**: Suggests checking URL or searching from homepage

## Files Modified

### `/src/App.tsx`
**Changes**:
1. **Imports**: Added `NotFoundPage` component, removed `Navigate` from react-router-dom
2. **RecipePage function**:
   - Changed from `<Navigate to="/" replace />` to `<NotFoundPage />` when slug is missing
   - Changed from `<Navigate to="/" replace />` to `<NotFoundPage />` when recipe not found
3. **Routes**:
   - Changed catch-all route from `<Navigate to="/" replace />` to `<NotFoundPage />`

**Before**:
```tsx
if (!recipe) {
  return <Navigate to="/" replace />
}
```

**After**:
```tsx
if (!recipe) {
  return <NotFoundPage />
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Invalid URL ‚Üí Silently redirected to homepage
- Missing recipe ‚Üí Silently redirected to homepage
- No feedback to user about what went wrong
- Confusing when sharing broken links

### After
- Invalid URL ‚Üí Shows clear 404 page with error message
- Missing recipe ‚Üí Shows 404 page explaining recipe doesn't exist
- User gets helpful feedback and navigation options
- Better for debugging and link sharing

## Testing Scenarios

To test the 404 page, navigate to:
1. **Invalid route**: `http://localhost:5000/invalid-page` ‚Üí Shows 404
2. **Missing recipe**: `http://localhost:5000/recipe/does-not-exist` ‚Üí Shows 404
3. **Valid recipe**: `http://localhost:5000/recipe/durban-beef-curry` ‚Üí Shows recipe (no 404)
4. **Homepage**: `http://localhost:5000/` ‚Üí Shows homepage (no 404)

## Design Features

### Layout
- Centered content with max-width for readability
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Responsive design (works on mobile, tablet, desktop)

### Content
- **Error Code**: Large "404" in primary color
- **Heading**: "Recipe Not Found" 
- **Message**: Friendly explanation with cooking theme
- **Icon**: üç≥ emoji for visual interest
- **Actions**: Two clear buttons for navigation
- **Help Text**: Additional guidance at the bottom

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<main>`)
- ARIA labels for non-text content
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader-friendly structure
- High contrast text
- Focus states on interactive elements

## Integration with SPA Routing

This 404 page works seamlessly with the GitHub Pages SPA routing fix:
1. User visits invalid URL directly (e.g., `https://recipes.gordonbeeming.com/invalid-page`)
2. GitHub Pages serves `404.html` (redirect script)
3. Redirects to `index.html` with path preserved
4. React Router evaluates the route
5. No match found ‚Üí Shows `<NotFoundPage />` component
6. User sees a helpful 404 page (not a blank page or redirect)

## Follow-up

None required - the 404 page is complete and functional.

## Optional Enhancement (Future)

Could add a search box to the 404 page to help users find what they're looking for without going back to the homepage first.
