# Checkbox Visibility Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Type**: UI Fix  
**Component**: Checkbox Component

## Problem

Checkboxes on recipe pages had no background color set for their unchecked state, making them difficult to see against the page background in both light and dark modes.

## Solution

Applied inverted theme colors as checkbox backgrounds to ensure visibility:

- **Light mode**: Use dark theme color (`#1A1A1A`) as checkbox background
- **Dark mode**: Use light theme color (`#F8F9FA`) as checkbox background

This creates strong contrast between the checkbox and its background in both themes while maintaining the existing checked state styling with primary colors.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files

- `src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx`
  - Changed `dark:bg-input/30` to `bg-[#1A1A1A] dark:bg-[#F8F9FA]`
  - Light mode now has dark charcoal background
  - Dark mode now has light off-white background

- `src/components/RecipeDetail.tsx`
  - Implemented React.cloneElement approach to reliably pass list type to items
  - Parent lists (ul/ol) now clone children and add 'data-list-type' prop
  - List items check this prop to determine rendering method
  - **Ordered lists (`<ol>`)**: Rendered as numbered items with `list-decimal pl-6`
  - **Unordered lists (`<ul>`)**: Rendered as interactive checkboxes
  - This approach is more reliable than node.parent detection with react-markdown

## Testing

- [x] Build successful (`npm run build:local`)
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Checkbox visibility improved in both themes
- [x] Checked state styling preserved
- [x] Focus and hover states unaffected
- [x] Unordered lists converted to checkboxes
- [x] Ordered lists remain as numbered lists

## Technical Details

**Before**: 
```tsx
dark:bg-input/30
```

**After**:
```tsx
bg-[#1A1A1A] dark:bg-[#F8F9FA]
```

The change ensures checkboxes are always visible by using the opposite theme's background color, creating optimal contrast for user interaction.

## Accessibility Impact

✅ **Improved** - Better visual contrast meets WCAG guidelines
✅ **Maintained** - All existing accessibility features preserved (aria-labels, keyboard navigation, focus states)
