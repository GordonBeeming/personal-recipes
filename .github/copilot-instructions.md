# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a personal recipe website built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project is currently in transition and will be migrated to **Tina CMS** for content management.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, shadcn/ui patterns
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Markdown**: Marked, React Markdown
- **Future CMS**: Tina CMS (migration in progress)

## File Organization Standards

### Documentation Structure
**All documentation files must be organized in the `/docs` folder**, except for standard GitHub files.

#### Standard GitHub Files (keep in root):
- `README.md` - Project overview and getting started guide
- `LICENSE` - Project license
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policies and vulnerability reporting
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Community guidelines (if exists)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines (if exists)
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history (if exists)

#### Documentation Files (must be in `/docs`):
- Product requirements documents
- Architecture documentation
- Design specifications
- API documentation
- User guides
- Development guides
- Any other project documentation

### Task Documentation
All task outcomes from Copilot jobs and development tasks must be documented in `/docs/tasks/`.

#### Task File Naming Convention:
- **Format**: `YYYYMMDD-XX-topic.md` (XX is a two-digit order number)
- **Example**: `20250105-01-recipe-search-implementation.md`, `20250105-02-color-update.md`
- **Date Format**: Use ISO 8601 date format (YYYYMMDD)
- **Order**: Two-digit sequence number (01, 02, 03...) to track order of tasks on same day
- **Topic**: Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word topics

#### Task Documentation Guidelines:
1. **Minor Tasks**: Update existing task files instead of creating new ones
   - If a task is a continuation or update to previous work, append to the existing file
   - Add a new section with updated date header within the file
   
2. **Major Tasks**: Create new task files for significant features or changes
   - New features or components
   - Major refactoring efforts
   - Significant bug fixes
   - Architecture changes

3. **Task File Content Should Include**:
   - Date and brief description at the top
   - Problem/objective statement
   - Solution approach
   - Changes made (file changes, new dependencies, etc.)
   - Testing performed
   - Any follow-up items or known issues

## Migration to Tina CMS

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Keep Instructions Updated
**As the Tina CMS migration progresses, these instructions MUST be updated to reflect:**
- New content structure and schema
- Tina CMS specific patterns and best practices
- Changes to markdown file locations (if Tina manages them differently)
- New build processes or development workflows
- Updated component patterns for Tina integration

### During Migration:
1. Update this file immediately when major CMS-related changes are made
2. Document any breaking changes in a migration task file
3. Keep both old and new patterns documented until migration is complete
4. Add Tina-specific development guidelines as they are established

## Code Style and Patterns

### Accessibility First üåü

**Accessibility is a CORE requirement, not an afterthought.**

Every component, feature, and change MUST be built with accessibility in mind:

#### Required Accessibility Practices:
1. **Semantic HTML**
   - Use appropriate HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, etc.)
   - Never use `<div>` or `<span>` when a semantic element exists
   - Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1 ‚Üí h2 ‚Üí h3, no skipping levels)

2. **ARIA Attributes**
   - Add `aria-label` to icon-only buttons and interactive elements
   - Use `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative icons and images
   - Implement `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates
   - Add `aria-describedby` for additional context when needed
   - Use proper `role` attributes (e.g., `role="list"`, `role="status"`)

3. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
   - Implement visible focus states (never `outline: none` without replacement)
   - Support standard keyboard patterns (Tab, Enter, Space, Escape, Arrow keys)
   - Ensure logical tab order follows visual flow

4. **Form Accessibility**
   - Always associate labels with form inputs using `htmlFor` and `id`
   - Include helpful placeholder text and error messages
   - Use `type="search"` for search inputs
   - Provide clear validation feedback

5. **Visual Accessibility**
   - Maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios minimum (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
   - Don't rely on color alone to convey information
   - Ensure touch targets are at least 44√ó44 pixels
   - Support text resize up to 200% without breaking layout

6. **Images and Media**
   - Provide meaningful `alt` text for all images (describe content, not "image of...")
   - Use `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative images with empty alt (`alt=""`)
   - Ensure video/audio content has captions and transcripts

7. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)
   - Use skip links for navigation
   - Announce dynamic content changes with `aria-live`
   - Provide descriptive link text (avoid "click here")

#### Accessibility Checklist for Every Change:
- [ ] Can this be used with keyboard only?
- [ ] Does this work with a screen reader?
- [ ] Are color contrasts sufficient?
- [ ] Are all interactive elements properly labeled?
- [ ] Is focus management handled correctly?
- [ ] Are error states clearly communicated?
- [ ] Does this work at 200% zoom?

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Prefer type inference where possible
- Use interfaces for object shapes, types for unions/intersections
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown

### React Patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)

### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `RecipeCard.tsx`)
- **Utilities/Hooks**: camelCase (e.g., `useRecipeSearch.ts`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RECIPES`)
- **CSS Classes**: Use Tailwind utility classes, custom classes in kebab-case

### File Organization
```
src/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/     # Reusable UI components
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/          # Page components
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/          # Custom React hooks
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/          # Utility functions
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/          # TypeScript type definitions
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/            # Third-party library configurations
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/         # Static assets
```

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
1. Check existing patterns in the codebase
2. Review PRD.md (in /docs after reorganization) for feature requirements
3. **Review accessibility requirements** - ensure changes maintain or improve accessibility
4. Ensure changes align with the "elegant, accessible, delightful" experience qualities

### Making Changes
1. Make minimal, surgical changes - change only what's necessary
2. Follow existing code patterns and conventions
3. **Implement accessibility best practices** - semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard support
4. Update relevant documentation if making structural changes
5. Test changes locally before committing

### After Making Changes
1. Run linters: `npm run lint`
2. Build the project: `npm run build`
3. Test in dev mode: `npm run dev`
4. Document significant changes in `/docs/tasks/` following naming conventions

## Testing and Quality

### Before Committing
- Ensure no TypeScript errors: `npm run build`
- Run ESLint: `npm run lint`
- Test affected functionality manually
- **Test keyboard navigation** - ensure all interactive elements are accessible
- **Test with screen reader** - verify announcements are correct
- Verify responsive design if UI changes were made
- **Check color contrast** - ensure WCAG AA compliance

### Edge Cases to Consider
- Missing or failed image loads
- Empty states (no recipes, no search results)
- Long text content (titles, descriptions)
- Various screen sizes and devices
- Slow network conditions
- **Keyboard-only navigation**
- **Screen reader usage**
- **High contrast mode**
- **Reduced motion preferences**

## Important Reminders

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Guidelines
1. **Keep these instructions updated** - Especially during Tina CMS migration
2. **All docs in `/docs`** - Except standard GitHub files
3. **Task files use date prefix** - `YYYYMMDD-XX-topic.md` format (XX = order number)
4. **Minor tasks update existing files** - Don't create duplicate task files
5. **Document major changes** - Create task files for significant work
6. **Accessibility is mandatory** - Every change must be accessible

### When to Update These Instructions
- Adding new tools or dependencies
- Changing project structure
- Migrating to Tina CMS (major milestone)
- Establishing new coding patterns
- Adding new development workflows
- Changing documentation structure
